# Crevos
####A chromebook terminal development system </br>
###Do not install X11 until this message has been removed, it is currently having major bugs and crashed my chromebook several times and I needed to powerwash, So don't use remount-x command or install-x command until this message is cleared</br></br>
######Side note, crevos update won't update X11 or the actuall crevos command, to do so run the command crevos-reinstall, to get the most updated crevos, As you can see by the comments on average I fix a bug every 20 minutes 
This system was created by David Smerkous and Eli Smith from the Plano ISD Academy High School </br>
Crevos is an acronym for Ch<B>R</B>ome d<B>EV</B>elopment <B>O</B>perating <B>S</B>ystem</br>

  A lot of this is pre-made by skycocker, but pushing the new packages through chromebrew, was quite annoying for me, as in I wanted to have more access to the filesys without requesting for permission for every commit, this was made for school so if you want a general (As in not package/chromebook more specific kind of packages) got to chromebrew for better/probably better updated options, so we created a seperate repo, and are trying to get applications like, Arduino, Netlogo, etc... running graphically for chromebooks without crouton, To give credit for the base of Crevos here is chromebrew</br>
