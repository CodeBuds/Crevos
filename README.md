# Crevos
####A chromebook terminal development system </br>
This system was created by David Smerkous and Eli Smith from the Plano ISD Academy High School </br>
Crevos is an acronym for Ch<B>R</B>ome d<B>EV</B>elopment <B>O</B>perating <B>S</B>ystem</br>
This script is still under heavy modification and is in no way ready to be used. If you have any questions, DM either one of us.</br>
A lot of this is pre-made by skycocker, but I didn't want to go through pushing the new packages through chromebrew, so we created a seperate repo, and are trying to get applications like, Arduino, Netlogo, etc... running graphically for chromebooks without crouton
