Other Info

  A lot of this is pre-made by skycocker, but pushing the new packages through chromebrew, was quite annoying for me, as in I wanted to have more access to the filesys without requesting for permission for every commit, this was made for school so if you want a general (As in not package/chromebook more specific kind of packages) got to chromebrew for better/probably better updated options, so we created a seperate repo, and are trying to get applications like, Arduino, Netlogo, etc... running graphically for chromebooks without crouton, To give credit for the base of Crevos here is chromebrew</br>
